# Complex-Number-Power-Calculator-using-DeMoivres-Theorem

## Overview
This Python program leverages DeMoivre's theorem to calculate the powers of complex numbers. The user inputs a range of angles in degrees, the number of intervals between these angles, and the power to which the complex number should be raised. The program outputs the calculated complex numbers using two different formulaic approaches and compares their equality.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Math library (usually pre-installed with Python)

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `python main.py`.
4. Follow the on-screen prompts to input the number of intervals, maximum angle, and power.

## Features
- Accepts user-defined intervals, maximum angles, and powers.
- Calculates complex numbers using DeMoivre's theorem.
- Compares the results of two different equations to test their equality.
- Outputs the angle in radians, calculated complex numbers, and the difference between the two equations.

## Functions
- `computeDeMoivre(maxAngle, intervals, power)`: Computes the complex numbers based on user input.
- `displayLists(angles, cNumtoN1, cNumtoN2)`: Displays the calculated complex numbers and their comparisons.
- `main()`: Main function to handle user input and execute other functions.
